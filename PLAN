Development plan

1. Armstrong parallel SCARA printer model B
 * Redesign to solve imprecise motion in the original A1 design

1.1 New generation harmonic drives about done
 * Large diameter bearings to better constrain the motion
 * Drives stackable on a single axis, eliminating axis offset problems

1.2 Rigid chain actuator to move the assembly or the print surface
 * Done 

1.3 Constraining the motion of the rigid chain actuator
 * Sarrus linkage, WIP
